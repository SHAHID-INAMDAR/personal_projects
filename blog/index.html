                <P>It's 26 Decenber 2025 the first day i am writing a blog , it was quite a peacefull day today until my friend told me about the 
                    MAHAADBT registration ,I got so stressed I you can not even imagine , as soon as i reached home 
                    i tried to register as soon as possible but it's not working although the dead line for registration is 
                    march 31 2025 ,but the fact that everyone else other than me has registered is worrying me .
                    Also i have my aom exam tommorow and to be honesst I havn't studied anything ,it's a MCQ test so not much of a deal
                    but still I need to study something atleast.
                </P>

                    I don't know where to start from, the day was a bit off today , I woke up just on time got ready just one min before the bus arrived , I got the bus however but missed the second one 119 which i usually take 
                    to travel to college ,but at the end i got there on time wrote the paper (it was a piece of cake by the way), then just waited for an hour for the submission of pcs ,submiited the pcs submmisions, it was going well I was preparing to leave to home 
                    but out of nowhere ubed came up and asked me if  i am free , and if I am intrested in going out with them (archit ubed dhruv),I was not sure about it but then the thought of <em>"never miss anything"</em> came to my mind and I said yes,
                    . Soon I realised it was a mistake to say yes their standard is way beyond my limit, they are cool, rich, confident, they know a lot about world atleast more then me , I think ,what so ever, after the college we booked a taxi reached the destinaton 
                    and ate burger and<strong> believe me it was the shittiest burger i ever had in my life ,total waste of money absolute trash</strong>, obviously I didn't said this in front of them but it was literally the worst burger I ever had in my life
                    I promise myself to never got to that place agian ever the hotel or the restraunt or whatever u call it ,it was shitty too i don't know what made that place so popular ,
                    well let'snot talk about that anymore . huh... well that's it for today , nothing mouch happened after that ,but yes i wont'n go out with anyone anywhere until I know where they are going excatly .
                </P>

                    27 December 2025 Sunday , a really really boring day, I love sundays very much but I aslo hate it as much as I like it, zero productivity 
                    , did nothing meaningfulll today just watched some web series (chernobyl it was amazing by the way absolute cinema) wasted a lot of time
                    so one thing i learned today is , not to watch web series or watch maximum of only one episode no matter what, well I am also thinking of
                    building a website for the college students to help out each other and communicate , it's a very good idea, that is what I think, so from now on I will document 
                    everything about the progress of the app that I will build in the (priviyet) section of the web page, well priviyet means hello in russian ,and yes that is what I have decided to name it for now ,
                    also tommorow is my pps exam and i have not studied anything , nothing surprising, well i geusse that's all for today may be i will write something in
                    the priviyet section something about the app aim or the basic idea let's see, so today I learned the lesson that  do not watch web series or if i want to watch must watch not more than
                    1 ep per day and also not to sleep in the afternoon no matter what, wastes too much precious time .
