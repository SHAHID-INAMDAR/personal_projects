                <h2>DAY 1 </h2>
                <P>It's 26 Decenber 2025 the first day i am writing a blog , it was quite a peacefull day today until my friend told me about the 
                    MAHAADBT registration ,I got so stressed I you can not even imagine , as soon as i reached home 
                    i tried to register as soon as possible but it's not working although the dead line for registration is 
                    march 31 2025 ,but the fact that everyone else other than me has registered is worrying me .
                    Also i have my aom exam tommorow and to be honesst I havn't studied anything ,it's a MCQ test so not much of a deal
                    but still I need to study something atleast.
                </P>
